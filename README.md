# Rodolfod1.passwordGenerator
Password Generator

#My approach to this password generator:
- This code was designed to contain loops, lists, arrays and simple functions.
- The main idea is to manipulate numbers to represent all characters on Ascii code; after all number manipulation (random between ranges, sorting, pushing to arrays) the final array is populated with ascii characters.
