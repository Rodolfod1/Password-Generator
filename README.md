# Rodolfod1.passwordGenerator
Password Generator

** My approach to this password generator: **
- This code was designed to contain loops, lists, arrays and simple functions.
- The main idea is to manipulate numbers to represent all characters on Ascii code; after all number manipulation (random between ranges, sorting, pushing to arrays) the final array is populated with ascii characters. 

* Style:
- Existing html and css, were modified to adapt a sober and bold style. 
 
 * About Javascript. 
  - simple variables were used to gain efficiency on coding and debugging. 
  - balance between global and local variables to facilitate and easier analysis and debugging.
  
  *This Project contents:
  - Index.html - hosting the web page application .
  - Script.js - Code for executing the app. 
  - style.css - original + customized style for the application. 
  - capture.html - visual aid of deployed application and code structure. 
  - screen.css- just a stylesheet for the screen shots
